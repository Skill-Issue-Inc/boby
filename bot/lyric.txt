We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you



Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on, and on, and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on, and on, and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people



Slow down you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart tell me,
Why are you still so afraid? (mmmmm)

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day (Ay)

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Slow down you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight (tonight)

Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)

You got your passion, you got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true (Oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Slow down you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two (oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (oooh)
Why don't you realize... Vienna waits for you?

When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?



It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet
And I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As a smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place."

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes they're sharing a drink they call "Loneliness"
But it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright



Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man
Well, it surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more no!

Carry on
You will always remember
Carry on
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more



On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine."
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"



Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex

Two pickup trucks
Making love
American made
Built Ford Tough
Two beautiful
Murder machines
American angels in the sky
Grown men cry

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex (huh!)
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex (ha!)

Right by my side
There's ZZ Top
And Robert Z'Dar
From Maniac Cop
1, 2, and 3
This barbecue could bring you to your knees
And so could these
Two trucks

Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
Is more than I can withstand
Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
My big fat heart expands

Two pickup trucks
One cylinder block
Crush my body
Like a rock
So beautiful
No stars tonight
Just fireworks and eagles in the sky
The Founding Fathers cry

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily! Huh! Flex!

Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex!
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex!
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin,
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget,
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up,
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl

She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl



Once upon a time not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot."

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay, someday

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Livin' on a prayer

We've gotta hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

whoa were halfway there
WHAOHOA! ***SQUIDWARD IN A CHAAIR***



I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Let's talk about love
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me
Show me love is real, yeah
I wanna know what love is...



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

All that you know oxidizes and turns to rust
I can't see my way out of this and escape seems futile 
And the paper's due on Monday

I was new, I was mad
I was a cat in the wrong bag

On a pointless journey, worthless story
Nothing left to do 
Messed with the best, now rest with the mess
You're a dog and a box living in a shoe

Sitting there with your teeth in your mouth you
Can't see the fortress for the trees
Shot your self in the foot, you shot it
Shot your self in the IT

Now, understand, I'm a 
Very important man

(WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE         THEY DIDN'T HAVE PIZZA)

When all that you know and love
Is bought up and replaced by jerks
It just goes to show it doesn't get any better

I was a rich man
I pressed a button
Several copies appeared to me of the button (Adjacently)

I was a poor man
I pressed a button
But I was left with no more buttons
When the wave-function collapsed

It's a 
Pointless journey
Worthless story
Nothing left to prove
You messed with the test, now test with the rest
You're a clog and a fox living in a flue

No one could get No one could get the thing they wanted
It was mounted on a spring
Try not to ask Try not to ask about my camera
It was damaged in the fall

Now, understand, I'm a 
Very important man

(WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE         WE DIDN'T HAVE CAMERAS)

And when all that you know and love
Is bought up and replaced by jerks
It just goes to show it's a pointless journey.


Inexplicably hilarious
The day I realized that my hands, they were a vector for fingers 
Inexplicably hilarious
The day I realized that my fingers were a vector for hands.

And it was just at that moment
I was kicked out of math class

Some people never had experience with hands

Inexplicably hilarious 
The day I realized 
That the words the man had said at the podium
When I was seated at a lecture were phrased in such a way as to be comical
And it was just at that moment
I was kicked out of Congress
For being a colossal nerd

Ostracized, I was ostracized 
In the capitol, in the capitol
Ostracized, I was ostracized
When I ran into that column in the capitol

Inexplicably hilarious
Inexplicably hilarious!

Inexplicably hilarious
The day I realized that my legs they were a vector for feet
Inexplicably hilarious
The day I realized that my feet they were a vector for shoes
And it was just at that moment
I was thrown out of English
For taking off my shoes

Then in a maze of twisty passages all alike
I found the exit when the government took my bike
I went up to the office of the man in charge
And asked what gives
He said that life is a series 
Of small inconveniences
Followed by the biggest one of them all

Inexplicably hilarious 
The day I realized that the world was just a form of a library
Where the robots were unhelpful and took your shoes
And stole your keys
And it was just at that moment
I was struck by how SIMPLE
The thing I ran into really was.


(I forgot to tell you) 
What with the paper cuts and
(I forgot to tell you) 
What with the noisy cats and
(I forgot to tell you) 
Can't turn the speakers off they
(I forgot to tell you)
Come right back on again

I FELL IN LOVE WITH A POTTED PLANT
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
WHILE YOU WERE GONE (WHILE YOU WERE GONE [WHILE YOU WERE GONE])

(I forgot to tell you) The car won't leave me alone
(I forgot to tell you) I brought it in the house
(I forgot to tell you) No one to answer the phone
(I forgot to tell you) It's just that guy again!

I FELL IN LOVE WITH A POTTED PLANT
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
WHILE YOU WERE GONE (WHILE YOU WERE GONE [WHILE YOU WERE GONE]))))))

I was away for a long long time
Where I was they didn't have homework
Now I can't get my head around this!!

This place is out of control
Can't find a place to sit
Wish I could get me some food
(It's all on television.)

I could start my own country!
I could have my own house!

I FELL IN LOVE WITH A POTTED PLANT
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
WHILE YOU WERE GONE (WHILE YOU WERE GONE [WHILE YOU WERE GONE])

I was away for a long long time
Where I was                                They didn't have haircuts
Now I can't get my hair around this

And I RESENT the remarks you made about my stupid haircut
And I RESENT the fact that you gave me this stupid haircut
And I RESENT that every time I turn around someone has moved my head

And I NEVER ascribed to malice that which 
could be adequately explained by incompetence

No I NEVER ascribed to malice that which 
could be adequately explained by incompetence

Disregard what you thought you had heard
I was using a pseudonym

Events occuring in the rearview mirror may be
More important than the real ones

You thought you had the files but they only were the documents
The government men took away all your stuff

And every tiny sound you hear
Every voice from through a tube says

Disregard what you thought you had heard
I was using a pseudonym

Events occuring in the rearview mirror may be 
More important than the real ones

Every face has a secret face
Every name has an internal name

Everything has an alias
Every man has his problems


A fool and his problems 
Soon separated, concentrated
Coalesce into the new wave dance craze
Hot funk cool punk room full of junk
Got my woofers in the cabin and my tweeters in the trunk

(WHAT.) Talkin' bout my pseudonym
(WHAT.) Talkin' bout my acronyms        (GO    [GO])
For every man there's an equal and opposite alter ego
Every man has a pseudonym

And I apologize
For any economic hardships that may have incurred
Whilst I was using my pseudonym
I apologize
For any legal entanglements that may have ensued
Whilst I was using a [SYNTHESIZERS.]

So disregard what you thought you had heard
I was using a pseudonym
Events occuring in the rear view mirror may be 
More important than the real ones

Every face has a secret face
Every name has an internal name
Every man has an alias
Every man has his problems

Disregard what you thought you had heard        WRONG IDEAS DO NOT APPEAL TO ME.
Disregard what you thought you had heard        I REJECT EXTERNAL STIMULI.
Disregard                                       DISREGARD THE MAN ON THE SCREEN
I was using a Pseudonym.                        DISREGARD THE GUY ON THE
                                                                KEYBOARD.

Never twice the same colour
On phase-alternate lines I picked it up
Out of the blue

Out the window in the sky above my room
The tower where the signals nightly resumed
Emitted an eerie sort of hum

And even when I thought I was alone
There were the Bars and tone
(LIKE A DIPOLE SHOUTING DOWN A HOLE.)

Signals come and signals go
Some will change it to a different show
But late one night on a vacant channel
I found the answer to my problem
Truth in lines! Truth in numbers!
Fear of dots        Fear of people
And even when we all are gone
The bars and tone go on

And everything I thought was really there
Was electric waves passing through the air
Like a dipole shouting down a hole.


As I lay there with the car on my foot and a car in my head I was unable to tell
What the judge was saying to me, when the jury stood and shouted in unison

(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) As the undertow dragged me under
(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) As the bullet holes went through my guy

HOLD ON A MINUTE-- DON'T GET EXCITED
SLOW DOWN POINDEXTER, THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME MATHS.

As I sat there with a car in my car and a seat on my back I was unable to say
Thank you for killing my car, I didn't like it anyway, 
Thank you, thank you for not watching the road

(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) Couldn't breathe, couldn't 
                                      climb out from under
(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) As the microwaves barbecued my guy

HANG ON A MINUTE-- I HAVEN'T TESTIFIED
SLOW DOWN POINDEXTER, I'M GONNA NEED SOME PAPER.

[GUITAR PART]
Castle thunder came down from above
Castle thunder was the case 
Castle thunder was the case they gave me

Castle thunder came down from above
Castle thunder was the face
Castle thunder was the face on the screen

[END GUITAR PART]

(HIT BY) Uninsured motorist
(STRUCK BY) Uninsured motorist
(CRUSHED BY) Uninsured motorist
(KILLED BY) Uninsured motorist!

(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) AS THE BULLETHOLES DRAGGED ME UNDER
(IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE CASTLE THUNDER) AS THE LIGHT BULBS DAMAGED MY EYES.


I cannot do anything at all
Any time I try to use my feet
The horrid little man comes out to inform me
I must subscribe to use these feet

There was once a time had an original thought
But I was not authorized to think
I tried to write it down but I had to register 
My piece of paper was not mine

And everything I thought I knew
Everything I thought was meaningful
Every friend I ever had
was someone trying to sell me something

Problems weren't an issue after all
Every situation had occurred
Was no requirement to even do anything
There was no need for new ideas

[NES PART]

Monday came the Monday when I died
Shoddy manufacturing and 
Just out of warranty and
You don't go to heaven 
You don't go to hell
It turns out in the end it's just this guy

(YES, TURNS OUT THAT YOUR WORTH IN LIFE IS DIRECTLY DETERMINED 
 BY HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR YOUR SOCKS.)

And everything I thought I knew
Everything I thought was meaningful
Every friend I ever had
was someone trying to sell me something


I can't call you
'Cause you speak into the part you listen to
A long way off and I can't get through, I'm in Australia

Water flows
The wrong way down my kitchen sink
And hot comes out of cold, I think
I'm in Australia

WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND IT IS CLEAR TO SEE
EVERYTHING'S REVERSED OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT SHOULD BE
TRY TO MAKE A LEFT TURN GO TO THE RIGHT
SLEEP IN THE DAY AND WORK IN THE NIGHT

CAT COMES IN  CAT GOES OUT
ALWAYS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE DOOR 
TV PICTURE'S UPSIDE DOWN
RADIO WAVES DON'T WORK

Australia, land of magnets
Land where I left all my microphones
Don't make me go back there, ah no

I can't call you, when I try to dial a number it laughs at me
As I can't understand Japanese 
I'm in Australia

When I tried to drive my car to get some food
I backed into my living room, I'm in Australia

Where everything is backwards (MIRRORED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT)
Where everything is broadcast on television
And no one is safe from rocks

Australia, land of magnets, has a north pole and a south
Australia, land of magnets, there's no sound

Still I cannot reach you
The quarter comes back, the profits accrue
Still I cannot reach you


Computers are at my window making irritating noise
Computers are in the way when I try to look at the ground
And every time I feel strongly about something
Computers are there to tell me
I was wrong

Computers are taking showers that are very very long
Computers are using all of the hot water up again
And when you ask them to perhaps be a bit more considerate 
They pretend not to hear you and then give you jury duty

Get out of bed and fix this thing
It's out of ink and it's stolen my name
And every time I feel strongly 'bout something
Computers are there to tell me

I was wrong-- 
Wrong!

[COMPUTERS PART]

Computers are in the way when I try to lie on the couch
Computers are watching test patterns and radar weather maps
I try to object, it can't be done
Computers control all thoughts
Whether cars are bought or records played

It isn't up to you now
